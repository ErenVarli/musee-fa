# FA Project - Agile Method

## Overview

The FÃ¢ archaeological site in Barzan, Charente-Maritime, is growing in popularity, leading to visitor flow management challenges. To address this, a dedicated application was developed with the following goals:

- Adopt the Agile method to encourage team collaboration
- Secure online booking forms
- Simplify the booking process for visitors and staff

## Features

- **User-specific permissions:** To restrict access to sensitive data, control actions on the database, track user activity, and customize the experience according to roles.
